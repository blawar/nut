Freely walk the board: choose where to move, which Dice Block to roll, and how to win the most Stars in skill-based minigames. Wait till you see the 2 vs 2 mode with grid-based maps, the creative uses of the console, and the series\u2019 first online minigame mode!\n\nTest your skills in sets of five minigames with the new mode, Mariothon, and see how you stack up against players across the globe in Online Mariothon*. Whether you\u2019re pedaling tricycles, flipping meat, or who knows what else, you\u2019ll use Joy-Con\u2122 controllers in clever ways across 80 new minigames; some are all-out free-for-alls, others are 2 vs 2, or even 1 vs 3! Toad\u2019s Rec Room lets you pair up two Nintendo Switch\u2122 systems**, which you\u2019ll lay side-by-side on a flat surface like a real tabletop game. That way you can play a mini baseball game, battle tanks in custom arenas, or even see who can match the most bananas by repositioning the systems however you see fit!\n\n*Internet access required for online play. For more info, go to support.nintendo.com.\n\n**Additional games and systems may be required; sold separately.",

Increase your flip range, turn invincible, and more across 3 modes and 12 arenas! Compete alone or against up to 3 players to see who\u2019s best at each mode: flip the most panels before time runs up in Panel Battle, knock out the most opponents in Time Battle, or outlast your rivals in Life Battle. All 12 arenas have 4 layouts to choose from, some containing hazards like panel-flipping buttons, beam cannons, and waves so beautiful they truly stun competitors. Learn the art of the flip with tutorials and try your hand at achievements. When you\u2019re ready to compete, jump into an online* battle or a private room with friends via local wireless. No matter how you play, it\u2019s time to think fast and pull off the ultimate color scheme!",

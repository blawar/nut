The only limitation to solve puzzles is your imagination. Snip may need to cut Clip into a needle to pop balloons, or maybe they\u2019ll have to team up to form a squawking, egg-laying bird! \n\nWhen playing together, prove you\u2019re a cut above the rest in Blitz mode, where 2-4 players* can compete in a series of puzzlingly action-packed challenges. Three is never a crowd when you\u2019re paper thin, so make it a party! In Party mode, up to four players* can team up to solve tough challenges.

To win, flip the most panels to your color in local battles, online*, or single-player. The more you flip, the faster you\u2019ll move in a mad dash to nab power ups. Increase your flip range, turn invincible, and more across 3 modes and 12 arenas! Compete alone or against up to 3 players to see who\u2019s best at each mode: flip the most panels before time runs up in Panel Battle, knock out the most opponents in Time Battle, or outlast your rivals in Life Battle. All 12 arenas have 4 layouts to choose from, some containing hazards like panel-flipping buttons, beam cannons, and waves so beautiful they truly stun competitors. Learn the art of the flip with tutorials and try your hand at achievements. When you\u2019re ready to compete, jump into an online* battle or a private room with friends via local wireless. No matter how you play, it\u2019s time to think fast and pull off the ultimate color scheme!",

Wait till you see the 2 vs 2 mode with grid-based maps, the creative uses of the console, and the series\u2019 first online minigame mode!\n\nTest your skills in sets of five minigames with the new mode, Mariothon, and see how you stack up against players across the globe in Online Mariothon*. Whether you\u2019re pedaling tricycles, flipping meat, or who knows what else, you\u2019ll use Joy-Con\u2122 controllers in clever ways across 80 new minigames; some are all-out free-for-alls, others are 2 vs 2, or even 1 vs 3! Toad\u2019s Rec Room lets you pair up two Nintendo Switch\u2122 systems**, which you\u2019ll lay side-by-side on a flat surface like a real tabletop game. That way you can play a mini baseball game, battle tanks in custom arenas, or even see who can match the most bananas by repositioning the systems however you see fit!\n\n*Internet access required for online play. For more info, go to support.nintendo.com.\n\n**Additional games and systems may be required; sold separately.\n",

        "description": "DLC Pack 1 \"The Master Trials\" includes the following:\n\n1. Trial of the Sword\n2. Hero's Path Mode\n3. Master Mode\n4. Travel Medallion\n5. 8 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\n6. Korok Mask\n\nFurther information about the content can be found below: \n\n1. Trial of the Sword\n\nVisit a certain location to challenge the Trial of the Sword, where you must vanquish waves of enemies to progress from one room to the next. You will start this challenge completely bare, without any armor, equipment, or food items to aid you. Once you defeat all the enemies in a room, you can advance to the next. If you complete all 45 rooms, Link's mind and body will be strong enough to wield the Master Sword's full power and splendor any time the sword is usable! \n\n2. Hero's Path Mode\n\nA feature that allows you to view the path you've taken on your journey. It will record your journey for up to 200 hours of gameplay. Use this to find those shrines and Koroks that are still eluding you! You can even adjust the replay speed so you can manually select the pace you wish to watch your path unfold.\n\n3. Master Mode\n\nIn Master Mode, most enemies you encounter will be one tier higher than they originally were. For example, where you would normally see red Bokoblins, you will now likely see Blue Bokoblins instead.\n\nThere is also a new top tier of enemies that don't appear in Normal Mode! Additionally, enemies will recover health if you stop attacking them, and they will also notice Link more easily, so you may need to make adjustments to your fighting strategies. You also might find enemies and treasure chests floating in the air! Use these locations to your advantage to score treasure or even recover stamina.\n\n4. Travel Medallion\n\nThere is an item called the Travel Medallion hidden in a treasure chest somewhere. Place it at your current location and you will be able to travel there whenever you please. You can only register one location at a time, but this addition should aid you in your journey.\n\n5. 8 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\n\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series (Majora's Mask, Midna's Helmet, Tingle's Hood, Tingle's Shirt, Tingle's Tights, Phantom Helmet, Phantom Armor, and Phantom Greaves) will be hidden in 8 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule. There are hints to help you find these items hidden somewhere as well. Search for these hints and treasures while you journey across Hyrule!\n\n6. Korok Mask\n\nThe Korok Mask is an item that will be hidden in a treasure chest somewhere in Hyrule, and unlike the 8 items mentioned above, this one has a special ability. When Link wears this mask, it will shake when a hidden Korok is nearby!",

He must now prove himself by defeating enemies using the One-Hit Obliterator, conquering new Shrines, challenging a full dungeon, and overcoming many trials along the way. Once all challenges and trials have been bested, Link will obtain a new power known as the Master Cycle Zero!\n\nAdditionally, the bard Kass is traveling Hyrule to complete the unfinished song his teacher left behind. As Link and Kass chase their respective goals, Kass will share new original songs he wrote capturing lost memories of the four Champions and Zelda, previously unknown to Link. But that unfinished song... What could it be? \n\n*To play The Champions' Ballad, you must first complete the Main Quest to free the four Divine Beasts. \n\n2. 9 clothing items hidden in treasure chests\n\nItems honoring the legacy of The Legend of Zelda series will be hidden in 9 treasure chests scattered across Hyrule, including the Island Lobster Shirt, Ravio's Hood, Zant's Helmet, Phantom Ganon Skull, Phantom Ganon Armor, Phantom Ganon Greaves, and a Royal Guard outfit (complete with Royal Guard Cap, Royal Guard Uniform, and Royal Guard Boots).\n\n3. Ancient Horse Gear\n\nThe Ancient Bridle will increase a horse's number of spurs while equipped. The Ancient Saddle will allow you to call your horse no matter how far away they are. Both of these items will appear in treasure chests somewhere in Hyrule.",

It is faster, gains extra combat power if it\u2019s in a formation, and all of the units in its formation gain its movement speed. \n\n\u2022 Unique Improvement: The Kampung provides Housing, Production and Food for each adjacent Fishing Boat, and can be improved through further tech research later in the game. \n\nNew \u201cPath to Nirvana\u201d Scenario:\n\u2022 The lands around the Indian Ocean flourish with many religions and many people. Heaven has chosen you to bring the light to all these lands. Is your faith up to the challenge? In this 50 turn scenario, compete to have the most followers of your religion, the most faith per turn, and the most foreign cities following your religion.\n\nNew Wonder:\n\u2022 Angkor Wat: The largest religious monument in the world returns to Civilization! This temple must be built adjacent to an Aqueduct and provides Faith, plus it adds Housing and a Citizen to every one of the owner\u2019s cities when built.\n\nNew Natural Wonder:\n\u2022 Ha Long Bay: This breathtaking bay was designated one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2012, and provides Food, Production, and Culture, in addition to providing a large combat bonus to naval units in its tiles.\n\nNew Map:\n\u2022 Spread your empire through Southeast Asia in this new map, with a True Start and random location option.",

        "description": "Piranha Plant joins the battle as a stand-alone fighter in the Super Smash Bros.\u2122 Ultimate game! With its powerful bite, Poison Breath, and ability to call in Petey Piranha for a larger-than-life Final Smash, this fighter\u2019s ferocity is as sharp as its teeth. Ready your pipes and flowerpots; your opponent won\u2019t see you coming! (Then again, Piranha Plant doesn\u2019t really \u201csee\u201d either. It doesn\u2019t have eyes.)\n\nPlayers who purchased and registered the game before January 31, 2019 have until June 30, 2019 to redeem their codes and receive Piranha Plant for free. Players who did not qualify for the early purchase bonus can purchase Piranha Plant in the Nintendo eShop for $4.99 USD.\n\nNote: Piranha Plant is not a part of the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Fighters Pass. Therefore, this fighter does not come with a stage or selection of music.",

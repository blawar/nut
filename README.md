# Nut
This is a program  that automatically downloads all games from the CDN, and organizes them on the file system as backups.  You can only play games that you have legally purchased / have a title key for.  Nut also provides a web interface for browsing your collection.

You should copy nut.default.conf to nut.conf and make all of your local edits in nut.conf.

**If you only wish to rename / organize files, and not download anything, edit `nut.conf` and set all downloading options to false.** Your NSP files should have the titleid as a part of the filename in brackets.

It can download any titles you do not have a key for (for archiving), by enabling `sansTitleKey` in `nut.conf`.  These titles are saved with the `.nsx` file extension, and can be unlocked at a later time when a title key is found.

## Usage
 - Download [`nut`](https://github.com/blawar/nut/archive/master.zip)
 - If you'd like to download from the CDN, place everything in your already configured CDNSP directory. Specifically, you'll need:
	- `Certificate.cert`
	- `nx_tls_client_cert.pem`
	- `keys.txt`
 - Install Python 3.6+
 - Install the following modules via `pip`:
 	 - `pip3 install colorama pyopenssl requests tqdm unidecode image bs4 urllib3 flask pyqt5`
 - Configure `nut.conf` (see below)
 - Run `python3 nut.py --help` to understand options
 
## USB Install for Tinfoil
Run server.py or Windows users can use the precompiled nut.exe in the release section.

Follow the directions found in the release page to install the USB driver.

After you run the server, ensure NSP's are visible in the list.  If they are not, change the path and click the "scan" button.

Connect your USB cable from your switch to your PC.

Start Tinfoil, and all of the NSP's listed in nut server should now be available to install in Tinfoil.

## Server GUI
If you wish to run the server GUI, you must first download the images from nintendo.  You may do so with this command:
nut.py -s --scrape

This will take some time.  When it is complete, you can start the web server with:
server.py

Then point your web browser to localhost:9000

---------

## Configuration
All configuration is done via `nut.conf`.

### Paths
Configures how you want `nut` to store (and organize) your files. By default:
```
Base Games:		titles/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp
DLC:			titles/DLC/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp
Updates:		titles/updates/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp
Demos: 			titles/demos/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp
Demo Updates:		titles/demos/updates/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp

nspOut			_NSPOUT
scan (folder)		.
```

### Title Lists
`nut` will download, parse, and combine titlekey lists for URLs defined in `titleUrls` and `titledb\*.txt`. They will be loaded preferentially: first local lists (in alphabetical order), then remote lists. This is useful in case you'd like to maintain custom title naming (ie. in a `titledb\z.titlekeys.txt`

Acceptable formats:
```
Rights ID|Title Key|Title Name
01000320000cc0000000000000000000|XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|1-2-Switch

or

id|rightsId|key|isUpdate|isDLC|isDemo|name|version|region|retailOnly
01000320000cc000|01000320000cc0000000000000000000|XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|0|0|0|1-2-Switch™|0|US|0

or

id|name
01000320000cc000|1-2-Switch™

etc
```

### Whitelist
Place any title ids that you want to download in `whitelist.txt`, separated with a newline.

*If you want to download all games, leave the file empty.*

### Blacklist
Place any title ids that you do **not** want to download in `blacklist.txt`, separated with a newline.

# Nut
This is a program  that automatically downloads all games from the CDN, and organizes them on the file system.

You should copy nut.default.conf to nut.conf and make all of your local edits in nut.conf.

**If you only wish to rename / organize files, and not download anything, edit `nut.conf` and set all downloading options to false.** Your NSP files should have the titleid as a part of the filename in brackets.

It can download any titles you do not have a key for (for archiving), by enabling `sansTitleKey` in `nut.conf`.  These titles are saved with the `.nsx` file extension, and can be unlocked at a later time when a title key is found.

---------

## Usage
 - Download [`nut`](https://github.com/blawar/nut/archive/master.zip)
 - If you'd like to download from the CDN, place everything in your already configured CDNSP directory. Specifically, you'll need:
	- `Certificate.cert`
	- `Ticket.tik`
	- `nx_tls_client_cert.pem`
	- `keys.txt`
 - Install Python 3
 - Install the following modules via `pip`:
 	 - `pip3 install colorama pyopenssl requests tqdm unidecode image bs4`
 - Configure `nut.conf` (see below)
 - Run `python3 nut.py --help` to understand options

---------

## Configuration
All configuration is done via `nut.conf`.

### Paths
Configures how you want `nut` to store (and organize) your files. By default:
```
Base Games:		titles/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp
DLC:			titles/DLC/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp
Updates:		titles/updates/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp
Demos: 			titles/demos/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp
Demo Updates:		titles/demos/updates/{name}[{id}][v{version}].nsp

nspOut			_NSPOUT
scan (folder)		.
```

### Title Lists
`nut` will download, parse, and combine titlekey lists for URLs defined in `titleUrls` and `titledb\*.txt`. They will be loaded preferentially: first local lists (in alphabetical order), then remote lists. This is useful in case you'd like to maintain custom title naming (ie. in a `titledb\z.titlekeys.txt`

Acceptable formats:
```
Rights ID|Title Key|Title Name
01000320000cc0000000000000000000|XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|1-2-Switch

or

id|rightsId|key|isUpdate|isDLC|isDemo|name|version|region|retailOnly
01000320000cc000|01000320000cc0000000000000000000|XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|0|0|0|1-2-Switch™|0|US|0

or

id|name
01000320000cc000|1-2-Switch™

etc
```

### Whitelist
Place any title ids that you want to download in `whitelist.txt`, separated with a newline.

*If you want to download all games, leave the file empty.*

### Blacklist
Place any title ids that you do **not** want to download in `blacklist.txt`, separated with a newline.
